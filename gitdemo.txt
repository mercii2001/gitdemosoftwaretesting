I take immense pride in leading a team of eight individuals in a computer fest where we emerged as the runners-up, showcasing our collective technical prowess. Simultaneously, I actively participated in various fests, earning accolades and prizes. Complementing my practical experience, I pursued numerous courses to enhance my technical skills, and I successfully completed a SWAYAM exam on Artificial Intelligence, demonstrating my commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements. Additionally, I undertook diverse projects in various programming languages, showcasing my versatility and proficiency. These experiences have not only honed my leadership abilities but also enriched my technical expertise, making me a well-rounded contributor to the ever-evolving field of technology.
